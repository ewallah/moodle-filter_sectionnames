# Section name auto link filter

Faculty had been creating hard links to jump from section to section if need be.  From year to year this has caused issues with links to past courses that the current student did not have access to.

This plugin was built off of Moodle core's activity auto filter.  It will convert any instance of the exact section name into links to the section or bookmark links if on the same page.
